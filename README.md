# CubeSat_Captsone

For my senior year capstone project, I worked with Vega Cubesat to create a little cubesat sattelite using an OpenMV camera to take pictures, a PocketBeagle as the microcontroller, two radios to send data between the ground station and the microcontroller, and a GUI on a ground station. I worked on the connection between the OpenMV camera and the PocketBeagle along with integrating that process into the GUI.
